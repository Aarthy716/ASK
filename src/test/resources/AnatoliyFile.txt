today July 21 2020 git practice
**1 - Cut your own branch from master locally, typing:**
 `git checkout -b name_of_your_branch `
**2 - and create remote copy **
`git push --set-upstream origin name_of_your_branch`
 The name of your local branch must match the name of your remote branch. Example (You can see in terminal): * [new branch] nik -> nik

`git branch`  to verify that you created the branch (your currently branch will appear in green)

**6 - git add .** - add all changes to staging.  OR **git add /user/name/IdeaProject/..../your file.txt**
**7 - git status** - to sure you added changes.
**8 - git commit -m "message"** - to add changes from stage to local your branch with message.
